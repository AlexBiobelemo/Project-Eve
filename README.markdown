Eve: An AI-Powered Data Analytics Platform
Eve is an open-source, AI-driven data analytics platform designed to turn raw data into actionable insights with maximum efficiency. From automated data cleaning and advanced machine learning to a conversational AI assistant, Eve provides an end-to-end analytics workflow in a single, intuitive interface.

This project was a solo development challenge, built from scratch in just 10 days on a 4GB RAM laptop (HP Probook 6560b) with a $0 budget, often navigating constant power outages. It was an experiment in pushing the boundaries of creativity and performance engineering with minimal resources.

✨ Key Features (Eve Ultra)
🤖 Conversational AI Assistant: Ask questions and perform actions using natural language. (e.g., "Clean NaNs in sales" or "Create a scatter plot of profit vs sales").

🧹 Automated Data Cleaning Studio: Get intelligent suggestions for handling missing data, converting data types, and managing outliers with one-click fixes.

🔍 Anomaly Detection Engine: Use powerful algorithms like Isolation Forest and Z-Score to automatically identify unusual data points.

🧠 Advanced ML Studio: Train, compare, and analyze multiple models, including Random Forest and Neural Networks (MLP).

🤖 AutoML Capabilities: Automatically compare different models to find the best performer for your specific regression or classification task.

📈 Interactive Visualizations: Build a wide range of dynamic charts and dashboards with a simple, intuitive UI.

⚡ Performance-Obsessed Architecture: Heavily optimized with smart sampling, advanced caching, and efficient libraries (DuckDB) to run smoothly on low-resource systems.

** accessibility_features Accessibility First**: Includes themes for high-contrast and colorblind-friendly viewing.
