# Improvements for Model Performance

Based on the provided test results, several enhancements were made to improve model performance, particularly focusing on silhouette scores for clustering and addressing negative CV scores for supervised models. Below are the key improvements:

## Excel File Loading
- **Issue**: Excel (.xlsx) files were not loading correctly.
- **Fix**: Ensured the `openpyxl` engine is explicitly used in `pd.read_excel`. Added a `seek(0)` to reset the file pointer before reading, ensuring compatibility with Streamlit's file uploader.

## K-Means Clustering
- **Issue**: Silhouette scores were moderate (e.g., 0.4529 for small dataset, 0.2780 for medium dataset).
- **Improvements**:
  - Enhanced `optimal_k` function to evaluate silhouette scores for clusters from 2 to min(11, n_samples), ensuring the best k is selected.
  - Applied `StandardScaler` consistently in `preprocess_clustering` to normalize data, improving cluster separation.
  - Added error handling for insufficient data or invalid numeric columns.

## DBSCAN Clustering
- **Issue**: Poor silhouette scores (e.g., -1.0000 for medium dataset) and inconsistent cluster counts.
- **Improvements**:
  - Reduced default `eps` from 1.0 to 0.5 to better capture dense clusters in smaller datasets.
  - Improved error handling for cases where `min_samples` exceeds available data or when silhouette scores cannot be computed.
  - Adjusted UI sliders to allow finer `eps` tuning (0.1â€“3.0 range).

## Random Forest and XGBoost
- **Issue**: Negative CV scores (e.g., -16.6569 for Random Forest, -13.4358 for XGBoost on small dataset) and low classification accuracy (0.3104 on large dataset).
- **Improvements**:
  - Introduced `StratifiedKFold` for classification tasks to ensure balanced class distribution in cross-validation, fixing NaN and negative CV scores.
  - Applied `pd.factorize` consistently to classification targets in both `perform_random_forest` and `perform_xgboost` to handle categorical labels properly.
  - Expanded hyperparameter grids in `RandomizedSearchCV` for better optimization:
    - Random Forest: Added `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`.
    - XGBoost: Included `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `subsample`.
  - Improved preprocessing in `preprocess_ml` to handle categorical encoding and scaling robustly.

## General Enhancements
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages to provide actionable feedback (e.g., "Select valid numeric columns or clean the data").
- **UI Improvements**: Updated the "Help & Tutorials" section with detailed troubleshooting tips for common issues like file loading and model failures.
- **Performance**: Optimized data preprocessing to avoid redundant computations and ensure compatibility with datasets of varying sizes (150 to 9471 rows).

These changes aim to improve silhouette scores for clustering (targeting >0.5 where possible) and ensure positive, meaningful CV scores for supervised models.
